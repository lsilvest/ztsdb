* Global env shared by all, never popped
* Each connection gets its env, can assign to top env with <<-
- at comm level, we keep track of connections (to know if we need to send out or not)
- at interp level we keep track of connections with environment
- one to one mapping at these levels ensured through eventfd
* what is a connection:
- has it's own frame
- has it's own continuation: State, shpfrm
* the issue is: h ? E
** DB does not block waiting
** particular context does
- so the State, shpfrm and additional indicator
